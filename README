Note: This is my self-created project to help me learn to program.

This script is designed to connect to opensubtitles.org via a Python wrapper with the given username/password, search for subtitles for the given video file (using hash/file size), then downloading the subtitle file into the same directory as the original video file.

Why: I like to watch movies and TV shows with subtitles. I noticed that a lot of my videos did not have subtitles embedded in the files. I also couldn't find a good automated solution that already existed (how original of me, huh?)

The first argument is the path to the file or folder you would like to get subtitles for. Specifying a folder will prompt the user for confirmation before performing a batch download

The second and third arguments are your opensubtitles.org username/password (required for API usage)


Usage:    $ python getsubs.py [file | folder] [username] [password]
